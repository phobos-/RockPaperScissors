# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game implemented in a purely functional way, using fs2-Streams and Free Monads.

As Sheldon explains, `Scissors cuts paper, paper covers rock, rock crushes lizard, lizard poisons Spock, Spock smashes scissors, scissors decapitates lizard, lizard eats paper, paper disproves Spock, Spock vaporizes rock, and as it always has, rock crushes scissors.` Easy.
